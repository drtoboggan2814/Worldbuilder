# Worldbuilder
- Based off of the world generation system in GURPS Space 4E.
- Developed primarily from March 2020 into early 2021 as a personal project.
- The scope of the project was 32 parsecs from the Sun, with data primarily from the [HYG Database](https://github.com/astronexus/HYG-Database).
- worldBuilder proper was written in C++.
	- Python's Panda library was used to format the data and to get additional information from the internet.
